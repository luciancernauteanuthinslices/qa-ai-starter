# Test Execution Summary

## 📊 Overall Results
- **Total Tests**: 4
- **Passed**: 2 ✅
- **Failed**: 2 ❌
- **Success Rate**: 50%

## 🚨 Critical Failures

### 1. Another Test - Timeout
- **Issue**: Test execution exceeded time limit
- **Potential Causes**: 
  - Slow application response
  - Network latency
  - Resource constraints

### 2. Dashboard Test - Element Not Found
- **Issue**: Required UI element missing or not loaded
- **Potential Causes**:
  - Page not fully loaded
  - Element selector changed
  - Timing issues with dynamic content

## 🎯 Actionable Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Investigate timeout issues**: Check application performance and network connectivity
2. **Review dashboard selectors**: Verify element locators are still valid
3. **Add explicit waits**: Implement proper wait conditions for dynamic elements

### Process Improvements
- Consider increasing timeout thresholds for slow-loading components
- Implement more robust element location strategies (multiple selectors)
- Add retry mechanisms for flaky tests

### Next Steps
- Rerun failed tests after fixes
- Monitor test stability over next few executions
- Consider adding performance assertions to catch slowdowns early
